## Disclaimer 
Due to changes in the api, this website is no longer acurate, it is also no longer geting updated due to the end of the covid-19 pandemic.

## How does the website work?

 Acording to the South African department of health, 67% of the population  has to be fully vacinated in order to reach heard immunity.

from that we calculated the total amount of people, that would need to be fully vaccinated from the South African population, then we subtract the number of people already vaccinated to get the number of people who still need to be vaccinated, we then divided the number of people who still need to be vaccinated by the number of daily vaccinations averaged each week.

This is not the published version of the site, the only difference between this one and the published site is that this one uses downloaded CSV's however the live site uses a live API from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.
