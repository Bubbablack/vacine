This is a website that predicts when South Africa will reach heard immunity.

## How does the website do this?

 Acording to the South African department of health, 67% of the population  has to be fully vacinated in order to reach heard immunity.

from that we calculated the total amount of people, that would need to be fully vaccinated from the South African population, then we subtract the number of people already vaccinated to get the number of people who still need to be vaccinated, we then divided the number of people who still need to be vaccinated by the number of daily vaccinations averaged each week.
